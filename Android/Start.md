Quickstart Andriod
==================================================

There are a great and vast amount of resources to start learning development for Andriod. I recommend you to try and go through both the tutorials that are listed below.

For a first introduction to Andriod, the Developers at Andriod have created a great tutorial to explain, and go through the basic apps like "Hello, World".

This will take you through the basics of the technology, and get you familiar with the tools required to start development in Andriod.

Secondly, the key one a few individuals use is by Vogella, and goes through Andriod 4.2.

It's a good way to start development in Andriod as it goes through the different layers of learning.
