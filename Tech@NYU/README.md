[Tech@NYU](http://www.techatnyu.org/) - Who are we?
==================================================

Tech@NYU is growing the technology culture in New York City. We were created in Fall 2009 to connect technical and non-technical NYU students interested in building technology startups. Incubated with the help of the NYU Stern Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Tech@NYU held its first event in October 2009 to help students form teams for the Stern Business Plan Competition.

Events
-------------------

Now, our events are routinely attended by over 2,000 members of the NYU undergrad and graduate community as well as technologists residing in New York City. We are an officially-recognized NYU All-Square club.

We hold events throughout the academic year, open to all students, with a focus on consistency as to build community:

- Every week, we host HackDays, Learn to Code, and, in collaboration with Parsons The New School of Design, DesignDays.
- Every month, we hold DemoDays. Projects students have worked on, either at HackDays, DesignDays, or in their dorm rooms get two to five minutes each to show the rest of the student population what they've produced. This is a celebration of sorts, a celebration of creation.
- Every semester, we host Startup Week, a weeklong event dedicated to the innovation occurring NYC and exposing students to startup culture.

We also engage regularly with a number of NYC entrepreneurs who serve as mentors to students. Only a couple years old, Tech@NYU is one of the most diverse, most forward-moving student organizations in NYC.

Join our Movement

Technology moves mountains. It has transformed nearly every sphere of human activity it has touched, and Tech@NYU recognizes it as a potent tool to achieve human ends. By creating a culture around this tool, we can create a long-term and sustainable catalyst for innovation.

Tech@NYU has the largest footprint of any student tech entrepreneurship organization in New York City. We have ties to major schools in the area, including Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cooper Union, Parsons: The New School for Design, FIT, Pace, Pratt, Fordham, and Hofstra. In addition:

- Our bi-weekly digest has over 4000 subscribers
- @TechatNYU has 8500+ followers
- Our alumni have strong connections with the community: one alum raised $100K for hackNY, and another will donate $120K in scholarships for startup education for students in the next year
- We see ~2000 unique attendees over the course of the school year
- No other organization connects thousands of students to the larger ecosystem like us, nor prepares them for technology entrepreneurship like us. Join the movement.
