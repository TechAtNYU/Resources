[Go](http://www.golang.org/) - Resources
==================================================

Go is a programming language developed by Google in 2007. Go aims to provide the efficiency of a [statically typed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statically_typed#Static_typing) compiled language while being easy to program. 

The syntax of Go is similar to C: it uses curly braces, however semi-colons are optional. Variable deceleration are written differently, and it introduces new built-in types such as Maps, Array slices, and channels for thread-to-thread communication.

However, Go does not include the traditional type inheritance, pointer arithmetic, method overloading, or even generic programming. There is heavy usage of interfaces, and on Concurrency by using goroutines. 

To get a feeling of the language itself before starting to develop in it, there's a great presentation by Google:
