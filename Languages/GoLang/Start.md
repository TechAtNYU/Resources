Quickstart Go
==================================================

There are only a handful of tutorials and resources on Go online. We're going to be providing you with the best tutorials for starting the Go language.

Firstly, to get started with Go you should watch the introduction video by Google:

Next, the "Hello, World" of Go: (20 Minutes)

The "Hello, World" example is an important one to do as it gives you a perspective into the language before you start it. Use this tutorial to spend more time understanding some of the key components of the language before moving on.

After you get a feel of the language and understand the syntax you're able to do the Go Language Tour, which was created by Google. (4-5 hours)

    http://tour.golang.org/

This tour takes you all the way from Syntax, to Packages, to Conditional Statements, to Functions, all the way to Web Servers & Binary Trees. This is an important tutorial to do as it helps you understand the philosophies behind the language, and it's very interactive. It was made by the people who dreamt of the language, so they're the ones who can explain their philosophies best.

Moreover, after you've finished the Google Tutorial, there is final resource you can go through to dive deeper in some of the important concepts that are present only in Go. (5-6 hours)

This is a great tutorial on some of the key Go features, such as Goroutines (Concurrency), Web Servers, and some of the Object Orientated aspects go has, which weren't so clear in the Google tutorial.

Lastly, here are some other articles you're able to read about go to get an understanding of its uses:
