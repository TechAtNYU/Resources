Quickstart Python
==================================================

To start learning the basic syntax, there's Codecademy. It's a good resource to get introduced to the Python syntax, but not in itself an end. It's what you could use to get started with Python and it should take you a few days (max) to complete.

There are two great resources to develop your skills past the Syntax. If you're a visual learner - there's The New Boston, which is a great series of videos on Youtube.

If you learn through tutorials then there is an incredible Python tutorial called "Learn Python the Hard Way":

Two of these resources should be able to get through the basics of Python, and help you start developing and understanding the underlying libraries. You should by this end understand the syntax of the language, and some of the basic functions.
