[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) - Resources
==================================================

Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages, enabling Java and other programmers to be more productive. Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to three when compared to an equivalent Java application. Scala is both Object-Oriented and also provided full support for functional programming making it extremely flexible and helps cut down on code written.

Quickstart Scala
==================================================

Here are some resources to get started on your programming in Scala. 

To start with, the best way to tart learning would be to use The Scala School designed by Twitter.

When you start feeling more comfortable with the syntax and start to feel its power, try solving some math problems in Scala on Project Euler.

Novice Scala
==================================================

Now that you understand the power, and beauty of the language we will be looking at some of the libraries, and frameworks that come with Scala.

First of all is the web framework Lift. There is a great tutorial by David Pollock that introduces you to the lift web framework.
