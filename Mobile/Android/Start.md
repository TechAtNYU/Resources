Quickstart Android
==================================================

There are a great and vast amount of resources to start learning development for Android. I recommend you to try and go through all three of the tutorials that are listed below. You can choose between using the Youtube videos or going through the Vogella website.

For a first introduction to Android, the Developers at Android have created a great tutorial to explain, and go through the basic apps like "Hello, World".

This will take you through the basics of the technology, and get you familiar with the tools required to start development in Android.

Secondly, the key one a few individuals use is by Vogell, which goes through Android 4.2.

It's a good way to start development in Android as it goes through the different layers of learning.

Finally, there's a great set of Youtube videos by The New Boston on Android Development. If you're into visual learning or into podcasts then this is your best bet and starting off with Android.
