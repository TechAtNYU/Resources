[Android](http://developer.android.com/) - Resources
==================================================

Android is an open source Linux-based operating system. It was designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers. It's usually programmed in Java, C, or C++, and has Google Play, and APK as its package manager. 

It's used on the majority of smartphones over the world, and has dominated the market because of its open-source nature, and developer community.

Quickstart Android
==================================================

There are a great and vast amount of resources to start learning development for Android. I recommend you to try and go through all three of the tutorials that are listed below. You can choose between using the Youtube videos or going through the Vogella website.

To learn how to setup the development tools for Android you can navigate to this website:

- http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

This will explain some of the fundamental things you have to download and the requirements of your computer.

For a first introduction to Android, the Developers at Android have created a great tutorial to explain, and go through the basic apps like "Hello, World".

This will take you through the basics of the technology, and get you familiar with the tools required to start development in Android.

Secondly, the key one a few individuals use is by Vogell, which goes through Android 4.2.

It's a good way to start development in Android as it goes through the different layers of learning.

Finally, there's a great set of Youtube videos by The New Boston on Android Development. If you're into visual learning or into podcasts then this is your best bet and starting off with Android.

Novice Android
==================================================

Being a Novice at a programming language is always a very tricky period. On one side you're not experienced enough to create and understand libraries, but on the other hand you're good enough to build kind of advanced applications.

At this point we recommend doing as many guided tutorials in developing applications that you possibly can. Just go through the many different learn-how-to-build websites, but one we recommend is the "MIT App Inventor" website. It's a great way to start doing tutorials on projects from Basic to Advance level, and they're guided so you learn some of the more advanced features of the IDE and the language.

Advanced Andriod
==================================================

Another great way to improve your skills in developing Android systems is to go through the Reference Guide, and API guide that they provide on the development website.
