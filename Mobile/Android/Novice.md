Novice Android
==================================================

Being a Novice at a programming language is always a very tricky period. On one side you're not experienced enough to create and understand libraries, but on the other hand you're good enough to build kind of advanced applications.

At this point we recommend doing as many guided tutorials in developing applications that you possibly can. Just go through the many different learn-how-to-build websites, but one we recommend is the "MIT App Inventor" website. It's a great way to start doing tutorials on projects from Basic to Advance level, and they're guided so you learn some of the more advanced features of the IDE and the language.
