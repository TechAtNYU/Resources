[Tech@NYU](http://www.techatnyu.org/) - Programming Resources
==================================================

Tech@NYU is growing the technology culture in New York City. 

To get there, we need students continually building, to learn and internalize the nuances of great product and business. Tech@NYU is the sandbox that students need: a place to experiment, a forum for recognition, a community for discussion and sharing, and a stage for inspiration.

We're encouraging people to use our resources as they are heavily moderated by individuals who have experience with these technologies, and we aim to provide a place for individuals to find beginner to advance level resources.
