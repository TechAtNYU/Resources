[Tech@NYU](http://www.techatnyu.org/) - Programming Resources
==================================================

Tech@NYU is growing the technology culture in New York City. 

To get there, we need students continually building, to learn and internalize the nuances of great product and business. Tech@NYU is the sandbox that students need: a place to experiment, a forum for recognition, a community for discussion and sharing, and a stage for inspiration.

As there are too many different websites and places where allow individuals are able to find resources, we want to centralize it to a location where the community is able to contribute as well as our members.

We're encouraging people to use our resources as they are heavily moderated by individuals who have experience with these technologies, and we aim to provide a place for individuals to find beginner to advance level resources.

Structure
-------------------

We've broken down the sections into different places. 

    "Entrepreneurship": Resources on Entrepreneurship,
    "Languages": Programming language guides, 
    "Mobile": Mobile development guides, 
    "Utilities": Guides for utilities.

The structure of our resources is divided into different text files. Here is the hierarchy of our structure:
    
    - README.md: Gives you the basic information about the language, and updates on different versions
    - Start.md: The start file will contain links that will help you start learning about the topic - this will usually cover the syntax.
    - Novice.md: This are more advanced links for the language. This will cover more of the advanced syntax features of the language.
    - Advance.md: This will cover things that are specific to the specific language, and things it doesn't share with other languages.
    - /Examples: For some of the languages we'll be providing some basic code you can go through, or examples of some of the libraries you can use.
