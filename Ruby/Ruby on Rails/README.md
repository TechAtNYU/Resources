[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org//) - Resources
==================================================

Ruby on Rails is an open source web application framework which runs on the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework: it allows creating pages and applications that gather information from the web server, talk to or query the database, and render templates out of the box. 

As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server. You don't need Apache, or other engines to run it. 

Ruby on Rails features plugins, called Gems, that allow individuals to combine libraries, and projects other people have done into their own projects. For example, there is a gem called Devise that lets individuals easily create a user management system. The Rails community generates an incredible amount of Gems every month, and this is what keeps Rails going.
