Tech@NYU is growing the technology culture in New York City. 

To get there, we need students continually building, to learn and internalize the nuances of great product and business. Tech@NYU is the sandbox that students need: a place to experiment, a forum for recognition, a community for discussion and sharing, and a stage for inspiration.

As there are too many different websites and places where allow individuals are able to find resources, we want to centralize it to a location where the community is able to contribute as well as our members.

We're encouraging people to use our resources as they are heavily moderated by individuals who have experience with these technologies, and we aim to provide a place for individuals to find beginner to advance level resources.
