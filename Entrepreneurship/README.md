[Entrepreneurship]
==================================================

Tech@NYU promotes the growing technological culture around entrepreneurship, and the ventures it creates. We are all involved within the hacker culture around New York City in many different ways, and one of our key missions is to constantly "Ship" or build things for ourselves, for our community, and also for the fun of it. 

If you're not familiar with the [Hacker Culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture):

A hacker is someone who loves to program or who enjoys playful cleverness, or a combination of the two. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking.
